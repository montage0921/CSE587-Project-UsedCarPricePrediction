## Topic:
Predicting Used Car Market Value Using Machine Learning with Data Collected from Online Trading Platforms and Public Datasets.

## Motivation
We aim to predict the resale values of used cars using machine learning models by analyzing data collected from online trading platforms and public datasets. We would like to understand how car prices will fluctuate based on several features such as make, model, year, mileage, and conditions and we believe this model can help dealers, sellers and buyers make more optimal and efficient decisions in the used-car trading market. By completing this project, we hope to have a better understanding about data science and machine learning in general and also have hands-on experience of implementing knowledge to real-world applications.
  
## Dataset (can be multiple)
(1) Find public available datasets as examples to design data attributes and data structures.   
(2) Merge available datasets as our initial dataset. It will involve potential data.   
processing(repetition, abnormal processing, incomplete data processing)
(3) We will enrich the initial dataset by collecting data from online used car website, e.g.Carfax, cars.com, carvana. We will conduct data scraping, data processing and cleaning.

## Brief description of the method to acquire dataset 
(1) We plan to use scrapy and other Python scraping libraries to gather online HTML data from dealer websites as well as Huggingface API to download the public model and datasets. We will perform data concatenation to integrate and enlarge our datasets if applicable.   
(2)The datasets' distribution will be analyzed to detect any potential imbalance and scarcity.  
(3)Some potential types of EDA we plan to do include fluctuation of the price of used cars.
over time, relationships between each feature with the price, data distribution visualization, and missing data analysis. These can help us gain insights into our dataset before building our machine-learning model.   
(4)PCA/UMAP/t-SNE will be conducted to evaluate the cluster embedding of the datasets.
